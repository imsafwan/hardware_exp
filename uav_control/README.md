## UAV Control



1. Go to directory :
``` bash
cd ~/uav_control/src
```

2. Note: always check if the drone's ekf origin is correct. If the drone is shifted by hands , there are chances that ekf origin is not correct hence will the navigation be impacted by this.

Resatrting the drone will solve this.
 

3. Run UAV's code:
``` bash
python3 uav_action_test.py 
```
