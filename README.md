# Multi-Agent Hardware Experiment Framework

This repository provides a framework for coordinated multi-robot experiments with a UAV (drone), UGV (ground vehicle), and a central server. Each agent runs on its own autonomy atack and communicates progress and status over a shared WiFi network.

## Repository Structure

- `uav_control/` — Code and configs for the UAV (to be run on the drone's Jetson computer)
- `ugv_control/` — Code and configs for the UGV (to be run on the UGV's main computer)
- `central/` — Central server scripts (to be run on the manager laptop)
- `log/` — Logs generated during missions

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with detailed usage instructions.

## How It Works

- **Mission Plans:**  
  The files `uav_actions.yaml` and `ugv_actions.yaml` (in the `config/` folders) define the sequence of actions for each agent. These plans are generated by the mission planner framework.

- **Execution:**  
  The scripts `uav_action_test.py` and `ugv_action_test.py` translate high-level actions from the YAML files into control commands for the vehicles.

- **Communication:**  
  The system uses a centralized architecture. All agents (UAV, UGV, and central server) are connected to the same WiFi network.  
  - Each agent broadcasts its action status (success/failure) using UDP, with action IDs as keys.
  - Agents coordinate by listening for each other's status. For example, the UGV may wait for the UAV's takeoff to succeed before proceeding, and the UAV may wait for the UGV to allow landing.

## Getting Started

See the `README.md` in each subfolder for setup and run instructions specific to the UAV, UGV, and central server.
